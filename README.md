# bulminimal

Minimal Bulma CSS blog theme for Hugo by [tehuel](https://github.com/tehuel), forked by erei.

Differences in this fork:
- Display a notification when a blog has no content
- Fixed footer at bottom of the page
- l18n for the 404 page
- Uses [bulmaswatch](https://jenil.github.io/bulmaswatch/)'s Yeti theme, removing the vendored Bulma
